        Site by any Member or other user of the Site, including but not limited
        to photographs, videos, profile information, descriptions, postings and

        clarity, the license granted to ToyToy shall survive termination of your

        may have to use and exploit any such User Content submitted, posted,
        uploaded, published, or transmitted on or through the Site by you.

        You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for all User

        proprietary or intellectual property rights, or rights of publicity or
        privacy, or result in the violation of any applicable law or regulation.

        <br />
        ToyToy values your privacy just as much as you do. The Privacy Policy
        outlined below explains how we treat the information we collect when you
        visit the Site, Application and/or sign up for our Service or email
        correspondence.
      </div>
      <div className="sub-heading">Personal Information</div>
      <div className="para">
        During the registration process we may request your name, email address,
        physical address, telephone number, age, gender and toy preferences
        (collectively, "Personal Information") so we can match you with the
        proper toys and then send you the most appropriate subscription service.
        <br /> ToyToy does not collect any other personally identifiable
        information that you do not expressly provide.
      </div>
      <div className="sub-heading">Information Collection And Use</div>
      <div className="para">
        Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide an
        exceptional Service, improve the Site, Application, features and
        content, to administer your use of the Site and Application and to
        enhance your experience with the Service.
      </div>
      <div className="sub-heading">Feedback</div>
      <div className="para">
        ToyToy may from time to time ask you to provide information on your
        experiences with the Service, which will be used to measure and improve
        the quality of our Service. You are at no time obliged to provide such
        information. ToyToy reserves the right to use anonymized information
        that does not identify you personally for marketing purposes, for
        instance, by displaying selected comments without a user's identity on
        the Site, or in communications from the ToyToy team.
      </div>
      <div className="sub-heading">Cookies</div>
      <div className="para">
        Like many websites, we use "cookies" to collect information. A cookie is
        a small data file that we transfer to your computer's hard disk for
        record-keeping purposes. We use cookies for two purposes. First, we
        utilize persistent cookies to save your login information for future
        logins to the Site and Application. Second, we utilize session ID
        cookies to enable certain features of the Site and Application, to
        better understand how you interact with the Site and Application and to
        monitor aggregate usage by ToyToy Users and web traffic routing on the
        Site and Application. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are
        deleted from your computer when you log off from the Site, Application
        and Service and then close your browser. Third party advertisers on the
        Site and Application may also place or read cookies on your browser. You
        can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting
        cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you
        visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use
        all portions of the Site or Application or all functionality of the
        Service.

      <div className="sub-heading">Web Beacons</div>
      <div className="para">
        Our Site and Application may contain electronic images known as Web
        beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) and are used along with
        cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyse how our Site and
        Application are used and may be used in some of our emails to let us
        know which emails and links have been opened by recipients. This allows
        us to gauge the effectiveness of our customer communications and
        marketing campaigns.

        Information in their registration profile by contacting us at
        toytoylibrary@gmail.com or editing the relevant part of their profile
        online. If you would like us to cancel your ToyToy Account, please
        contact us or select the "Cancel" feature of the Service and we will
        attempt to accommodate your request if we do not have any legal
        obligation or a legitimate business reason to retain the information
        contained in your ToyToy Account. Please note that, if you cancel your
        ToyToy Account, anything you have posted via the Site and Application
        will remain publicly viewable via the Site and Application. Please see

      <div className="sub-heading">Business Transfers</div>
      <div className="para">
        ToyToy may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets,

        acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of
        bankruptcy.
      </div>
      <div className="sub-heading">Security</div>
      <div className="para">
        ToyToy is very concerned with safeguarding your information. When you
        enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social
        security number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that
        information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We follow
        generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal
        Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we
        receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of
        electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot
        guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about
        security on our Site and Application, you can contact us at
        toytoylibrary@gmail.com
        <br />
        We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the
        security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted
        electronically stored "personal data" (as defined in applicable state
        statutes on security breach notification) to you via email or
        conspicuous posting on the Site and Application in the most expedient
        time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with
        (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures
        necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the
        reasonable integrity of the data system.
      </div>
      <div className="sub-heading">Links To Other Websites</div>
      <div className="para">
        Our Site and Application contain links to other websites. If you choose
        to visit an advertiser by "clicking on" a banner ad or other type of
        advertisement, or click on another third-party link, you will be
        directed to that third party's website. The fact that we link to a
        website or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an
        endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with
        that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or
        information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control
        over third party websites. These other websites may place their own
        cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit
        personal information from you. Other websites follow different rules
        regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit
        to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of
        the other websites you visit.

        in a revised Privacy Policy on the Site. Such modifications will become
        effective on the day they are posted. ToyToy encourages you to
        frequently review the Privacy Policy for any modifications. If we make
