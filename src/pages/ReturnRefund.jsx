            is found to be missing pieces upon rental shall be considered
            un-rentable and damaged. The customer shall be charged a restocking
            fee up to or equal to 95% of the market value of the toy. The
            restocking fee does not represent a purchase of the toy by the
            customer as the damaged toy is being salvaged and need to be
            replenished.

            Any gift card that is applied to an existing account is converted to

          <li>
            Upon cancelation, the customer must return any rented toy within 14
            days. If the toy/s are not returned within 14 days the Member will
            be charged the market price of the toy/s. They charge could not be
            reversed even if toys were sent back at a later date and the toys
