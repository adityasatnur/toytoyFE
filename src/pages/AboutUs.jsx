      <div className="sub-heading">Story behind The ToyToy Library</div>
      <div className="para">
        Being in a family full of kids, we realized that in todays’ era it is
        very hard to keep the children away from the digital screens. Day by day
        children are losing their creativity and skills. It is also very hard to
        find suitable toys for children as their interest towards things keeps
        changing with the time. We realized, there had to be a smarter way to
        play. So, inspired by the growing interest in the sharing economy, we
        envisioned a library where every child can borrow a toy and then return
        it – Horray! It’s ToyToy.
        <br />
        ToyToy enables parents to delight their children with the toys they
        love, conveniently delivered to their door.
        <br />
        So join us to make your kid and yourself HAPPY��
